The AtlantisCmd package (:kbd:`atlantis_cmd`) is a command-line tool for doing various operations associated with the Salish Sea Atlantis project version of the CSIRO Atlantis ecosystem model. AtlantisCmd is based on, and provides Atlantis-specific extensions for https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/NEMO-Cmd.


.. _AtlantisCmdPythonVersions:

Python Versions
===============

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.11-blue?logo=python&label=Python&logoColor=gold
    :target: https://docs.python.org/3.11/
    :alt: Python Version

The :kbd:`atlantis_cmd` package is developed and tested using `Python`_ 3.10.
The package uses some Python language features that are not available in versions prior to 3.8,
in particular:

* `formatted string literals`_
  (aka *f-strings*)
  with :kbd:`=` specifiers

.. _Python: https://www.python.org/
.. _formatted string literals: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings


.. _AtlantisCmdGettingTheCode:

Getting the Code
================

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/version%20control-git-blue.svg?logo=github
    :target: https://github.com/SS-Atlantis/AtlantisCmd
    :alt: Git on GitHub

Clone the code and documentation `repository`_ from GitHub with:

.. _repository: https://github.com/SS-Atlantis/AtlantisCmd

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git@github.com:SS-Atlantis/AtlantisCmd.git

or copy the URI
(the stuff after :kbd:`git clone` above)
from the :guilabel:`Code` button on the `repository`_ page.

.. note::

    The :kbd:`git clone` command above assumes that your are `connecting to GitHub using SSH`_.
    If it fails,
    please follow the instructions in our :ref:`moaddocs:SecureRemoteAccess` docs to set up your SSH keys and :ref:`moaddocs:CopyYourPublicSshKeyToGitHub`.

    .. _connecting to GitHub using SSH: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh


.. _AtlantisCmdDevelopmentEnvironment:

Development Environment
=======================

The :kbd:`AtlantisCmd` package depends on the `NEMO-Cmd package`_,
so you need to clone its repo,
`NEMO-Cmd`_,
beside your clone of AtlantisCmd `repository`_.

.. _NEMO-Cmd package: https://nemo-cmd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
.. _NEMO-Cmd: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/NEMO-Cmd

Setting up an isolated development environment using `Conda`_ is recommended.
Assuming that you have `Miniconda3`_ installed,
you can create and activate an environment called :kbd:`atlantis-cmd` that will have all of the Python packages necessary for development,
testing,
and building the documentation with the commands below.

.. _Conda: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/
.. _Miniconda3: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd AtlantisCmd
    $ conda env create -f env/environment-dev.yaml
    $ conda activate atlantis-cmd
    (atlantis-cmd)$ pip install --editable ../NEMO-Cmd
    (atlantis-cmd)$ pip install --editable .

The :kbd:`--editable` option in the :command:`pip install` commands above install the packages from the cloned repos via symlinks so that the installed packages will be automatically updated as their repos evolves.

To deactivate the environment use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (atlantis-cmd)$ conda deactivate


.. _AtlantisCmdCodingStyle:

Coding Style
============

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg
    :target: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
    :alt: The uncompromising Python code formatter

The :kbd:`AtlantisCmd` package uses the `black`_ code formatting tool to maintain a coding style that is very close to `PEP 8`_.

.. _black: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
.. _PEP 8: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/

:command:`black` is installed as part of the :ref:`AtlantisCmdDevelopmentEnvironment` setup.

To run :command:`black` on the entire code-base use:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd AtlantisCmd
    $ conda activate atlantis_cmd
    (atlantis-cmd)$ black ./

in the repository root directory.
The output looks something like:

.. code-block:: text

    **add example black output**


.. _AtlantisCmdBuildingTheDocumentation:

Building the Documentation
==========================

.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/atlantiscmd/badge/?version=latest
    :target: https://atlantiscmd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
    :alt: Documentation Status

The documentation for the :kbd:`AtlantisCmd` package is written in `reStructuredText`_ and converted to HTML using `Sphinx`_.
Creating a :ref:`AtlantisCmdDevelopmentEnvironment` as described above includes the installation of Sphinx.
Building the documentation is driven by the :file:`docs/Makefile`.
With your :kbd:`salishsea-nowcast` development environment activated,
use:

.. _reStructuredText: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html
.. _Sphinx: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/

.. code-block:: bash

    (atlantis-cmd)$ (cd docs && make clean html)

to do a clean build of the documentation.
The output looks something like:

.. code-block:: text

    build succeeded.

    The HTML pages are in _build/html.


The HTML rendering of the docs ends up in :file:`docs/_build/html/`.
You can open the :file:`index.html` file in that directory tree in your browser to preview the results of the build.

If you have write access to the `repository`_ on GitHub,
whenever you push changes to GitHub the documentation is automatically re-built and rendered at https://atlantiscmd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.


.. _AtlantisCmdLinkCheckingTheDocumentation:

Link Checking the Documentation
-------------------------------

.. image:: https://github.com/SS-Atlantis/AtlantisCmd/workflows/sphinx-linkcheck/badge.svg
    :target: https://github.com/SS-Atlantis/AtlantisCmd/actions?query=workflow%3Asphinx-linkcheck
    :alt: Sphinx linkcheck


Sphinx also provides a link checker utility which can be run to find broken or redirected links in the docs.
With your :kbd:`atlantis-cmd)` environment activated,
use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (atlantis-cmd))$ cd AtlantisCmd/docs/
    (atlantis-cmd)) docs$ make linkcheck

The output looks something like:

    :alt: Hatch project

Releases are done at Doug's discretion when significant pieces of development work have been
completed.

The release process steps are:

#. Use :command:`hatch version release` to bump the version from ``.devn`` to the next release
   version identifier

#. Commit the version bump and change log update

#. Create and annotated tag for the release with :guilabel:`Git -> New Tag...` in PyCharm
   or :command:`git tag -e -a vyy.n`

#. Push the version bump commit and tag to GitHub

#. Use the GitHub web interface to create a release,
   editing the auto-generated release notes as necessary

#. Use the GitHub :guilabel:`Issues -> Milestones` web interface to edit the release
   milestone:

   * Change the :guilabel:`Due date` to the release date
   * Delete the "when it's ready" comment in the :guilabel:`Description`

#. Use the GitHub :guilabel:`Issues -> Milestones` web interface to create a milestone for
   the next release:

   * Set the :guilabel:`Title` to the next release version,
     prepended with a ``v``;
     e.g. ``v25.1``
   * Set the :guilabel:`Due date` to the end of the year of the next release
   * Set the :guilabel:`Description` to something like
     ``v25.1 release - when it's ready :-)``
   * Create the next release milestone

#. Review the open issues,
   especially any that are associated with the milestone for the just released version,
   and update their milestone.

#. Close the milestone for the just released version.

#. Use :command:`hatch version minor,dev` to bump the version for the next development cycle,
   or use :command:`hatch version major,minor,dev` for a year rollover version bump

#. Commit the version bump and change log update

#. Push the version bump commit to GitHub
